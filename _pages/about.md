## A restless thinking
I am a German innovation junky who loves travelling the world and learning about new fields, new tech and culture. This gave me an open as well as versatile approach to entrepreneurship and problem solving.

I spent most of my career in business (model) development and finance/controlling while founding and supporting startups. Finally, I found myself passionate about creating great products and businesses to support my goal of defining a sustainable and bright tomorrow.

It was just 2019 when I decided to upgrade myself to not only strategize about innovation and bringing them to the market, but also to build them myself. So, I chose to learn to code. This now leaves me being a Full-Stack developer eager to create and help innovative ideas and business.
