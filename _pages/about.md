## A restless thinking
I am a German innovation junky who loves travelling the world and learning about new fields, new tech, and culture. This gave me an open-minded and versatile approach to problem-solving and entrepreneurship.

Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in business model development, finance, and controlling while actively participating in the startup ecosystem. However, in 2019, I made a pivotal decision to upgrade myself and dive deeper into the world of technology. I embarked on a journey to learn to code, and since then, I have been working as a Ruby on Rails Engineer, specializing in creating innovative and high-quality software solutions.

As a Full-Stack developer, I possess a comprehensive understanding of both frontend and backend technologies, allowing me to craft robust and scalable applications. I am proficient in Ruby on Rails, a powerful and elegant web development framework, and I leverage its capabilities to build exceptional products that drive positive change.

My passion lies in creating great products and businesses that contribute to defining a sustainable and bright future. I thrive on transforming innovative ideas into reality and helping businesses thrive in an ever-evolving digital landscape.

With a deep understanding of software engineering principles and best practices, I bring a meticulous approach to my work, ensuring that every line of code is well-structured, maintainable, and efficient. I actively collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver solutions that exceed expectations and meet the needs of users.

In addition to my technical expertise, I bring a strategic mindset and entrepreneurial spirit to my work. I possess a strong foundation in business development, enabling me to bridge the gap between technology and business goals. I strive to align technical solutions with the broader vision and objectives of the organization, driving sustainable growth and success.

I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field of software engineering. I am excited to contribute my skills and expertise to innovative projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.
