### Chapter 2 - Designing Classes with a Single Responsibility
- always Single Responsibility
   - one class - one thing
   - one method - one thing
   - isolate extra responsibility in another class
- Determine: ask questions to the class and see if it makes sense
   > Please Mr. Gear, what is your ratio?
- Decide: future cost of doing nothing today > cost of doing today?
- Depend on behavior, not data: one place to access data
   - always use accessor methods
   - Hide data structures: accessing specific parts of a data structure (e.g. `array[0]`) depends on the structure. Use `Struct` or other objects instead
> Don't decide, preserve your ability to make a decision *later*.

### Chapter 3 - Managing Dependencies
> Knowing creates dependency.
- 4 kinds of dependencies
   - know name of class
   - know method you want to send
   - know arguments that a message requires
   - know order of arguments
- Law of Demeter violation: method chaining with other classes
  > object that knows another that knows another that knows something
- use dependency injection
  ```ruby
  # instead of
  def x(y, z)
    Foo.new(bar, foo) * something
  end

  # do
  def x(foo)
    foo * something
  end
  ```
- isolating dependency into its own method -> DRY and dependency of single method is reduced
  ```ruby
  def x(y, z)
    foo(y, z) * something
  end

  def foo(y, z)
    Foo.new(y, z)
  end
  ```
- isolate vulnerable methods, methods are called on a dependency -> DRY
- use verbose hash arguments instead of positional
