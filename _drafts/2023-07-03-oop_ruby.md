### Chapter 2 - Designing Classes with a Single Responsibility
- always Single Responsibility
   - one class - one thing
   - one method - one thing
- Determine: ask questions to the class and see if it makes sense
   > Please Mr. Gear, what is your ratio?
- Decide: future cost of doing nothing today > cost of doing today?
- Depend on behavior, not data: one place to access data
   - always use accessor methods
   - Hide data structures: accessing specific parts of a data structure (e.g. `array[0]`) depends on the structure. Use `Struct` or other objects instead
