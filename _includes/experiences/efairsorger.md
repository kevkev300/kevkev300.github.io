As a face-to-face consultancy based in Karlsruhe, Germany, for changing gas and electricity tarifs, we help private people to **save money**. Year after year, with a personal touch.

As **co-founder and executive partner** of this young and dynamic company I established the firm on the market and developed the concept further.

As **CTO**, I have the duty to make the company lean on the tech side. This means, decrease functionality to what is really needed and minimize administrative effort with smart tech solutions.
