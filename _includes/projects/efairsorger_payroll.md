## eFairSorger Payroll Panel

In this project I developed an online app for internal use. It automates the payroll for our consultants at my first startup.

I am using ruby on rails as a framework. It involves the roo gem to upload and read excel files, the wicked_pdf gem to be able to create very dynamically pdf files to download and I needed to build quite a heavy back-end logic.

Further, an API (microservices style) needed to be developed on both sides which led me also to dive into php.
