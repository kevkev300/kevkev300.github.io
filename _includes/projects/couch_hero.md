Taking part in #HackTheCrisisDK, we developed a prototype of a helper AI to answer questions about the corona virus. You can chat with it and even call.

Just consider, that this was developed in only 48 hours with a team that did not know each other prior the the hackathon. Still, I think we could show a nice idea.

My part in it was mainly developing the API to Google's Dialogflow AI so we could offer dynamic answers depending on the user's question. And of course some ideation and market strategy.
