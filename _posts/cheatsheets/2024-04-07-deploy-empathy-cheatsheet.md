Hello everyone,
I took some notes during reading "Deploy Empathy" by *Michele Hansen*. If you want to learn how to talk to customers to make great business decisions, including product development, just read it. So, I am providing my notes here (also for me to come back to). However, I strongly recommend everyone to read this book, you will get a lot out of it!

## What is this about?
- use customer interviews to tell you *why* something is happening. It will save you a lot of frustration
- empathy
  > understanding how another person thinks, and acknowledging [their] reasoning and emotions as valid, even if they differ from your understanding
  - you do not need to agree
- use interviews & empathy to include customers into decision-making & everyday process(es)
- people will already feel good if you just *listen, really listen*

## Part 2 - Key Frameworks
- Jobs-to be done
- Core questions
  > - what are they trying to do overall?
  > - What are all of the steps in that process?
  > - Where are they now?
  > - Where des the problem you are solving fit in that process?
  > - Where in that process do they spend a lot of time or money?
  > - How often do they experience that problem?
  > - What have they already tried?
- Functional, Social, Emotional
  - Processes have multiple purposes and **motivations**. They can have a functional, emotional and social dimension
- Valuable, usable, viable, feasible
  - Valuable: needed by customer?
  - Usable: can the customer use it?
  - Viable: can we make money with it?
  - Feasible: can we build it?

## Part 3 - Getting started
- user interviews to "validate" idea: be aware of validation bias!
- how many interviews
  - max. 2 per day
- Good interview? --> Walk away with "Wow! I didn't know that!"
- Narrow down your product scope if you get different insights from every interview
- Analysis is right when you identify the overall goal
- do regular interviews

## Part 4 - When should you do interviews?
- interviews are qualitative research (answering "why"). Also do quantitative research to answer "how many"
- project-based research
  - have narrow, defined question
- ongoing research
  - short surveys
    - the shorter, the better
    - open-ended follow-up question (e.g. NPS, what they used before...)
      - make sure they are straight-forward
    - answer to surveys to set up call
    - who to interview
      - just canceled
      - started within last 3 months
  - interviews
- how many people?
  - discrete problem --> ~5 interviews (~80% of needs found)
  - complex problem --> 10-15 interviews
  - general: "Stop when no new insights anymore"
- have a diverse group of interviewees
- Research loops
  - talk to 5 people
  - analyze
  - find interesting problems
  - find another group of 5 people to narrow further
  - repeat

## Part 5 - Recruiting Participants
- Where
  - Reddit & Forums
  - Twitter
  - LinkedIn
  - Facebook & email lists
  - Email
  - Surveys
- Be nice & human
- offer something (e.g. 20â‚¬ Amazon gift card)
- follow up call with mail
- **DON'T SELL** - it is research
- include in proposal
  - Who you are
  - time needed for interview
  - why you're doing it
  - why you want to talk to them
  - when you want to talk
  - what they get

## Part 6 - How to talk so people will talk
- Use a gentle tone of voice
  - most harmless, gentle, friendly, soft, judgement-free
- Validate
  - validating statements
  - use "think" instead of "feel"
  - e.g.: "That makes sense", "It sounds like that's frustrating", "Can you help me understand what wen through your mind when [X]?"
- Leave pauses for them to fill
  - at least 3 long beats
  - don't provide prompts or additional questions to not influence the answer
  - if too long and the interviewee says something like "still there?", make them feel important
  - > I was just giving you a moment to think
- Mirror and summarize their words
  - repeat words back to them
  - summarize what they said
  - use "it" not "I" when summarizing
- Don't interrupt
  - Active listening word are ok (e.g. "Mhmmm")
- Use simple wording
- Ask for clarification, even when you don't need it
  - without showing own knowledge, feelings, opinions
  - can also intentionally misstate to get more details
- Don't explain anything or get defensive
  - rather ask "Can you walk me through what happened?", "Can you tell me how you expected it to work?"
- Build on what they say
  - Don't negate them in any way
  - Never correct them
  - never say "no", say "yes and"
- Let them be the expert
  - because they are in their experience
  - if they are wrong where fact matter, mail them later but do not say in the interview
- Use their words and pronunciations
- Ask about past and current behavior
  - they won't tell you what their pain-points are or what they actually need
  - Ask about time and money already spent
  - Ask about how they do things now, what they use now
  - Did they try to solve things already in another way?
- Never break the bubble of trust
- Never imply your own opinion
- be a rubber duck

## Part 7 - Interview Scripts
- overall framework
  > - What they're trying to do overall
  > - The steps they take to do that
  > - What they've already tried
  > - Where they spend time and money throughout the entire process [how much do they currently pay for the problem?]
  > - How often they experience the problem
  > - How long it takes them
- How to conduct interviews
  - if possible, only audio
  - mute everything else, be uninterrupted
  - be able to focus
  - treat the day as you would for a job interview
  - have your questions noted down with space to take notes
  - it doesn't need to follow the order
  - take "fear" of interviewee to do anything wrong in the beginning of the interview
  - stick to the time
  - write a thank-you note
  - use the "reaching for the door" question
    - be done with your question around half of the allocated time
    - then ask:
      - > "Perhaps there are some things you're wondering about my side?"
      - > "Is there anything you're curious about from me?"
  - record the interview if allowed (ask before!) (e.g. Tool: Nugget)
  - capture all feature requests
  - ask others to join, but never more than 2 people
  - **DON'T SELL** - it is research
  - Types of interviews (scripts within book)
    - Discovery
    - New customer
    - Long-time customer
    - Canceled customer
    - Interactive interview (e.g. see how the user would use the product) - screen share
    - [Problems, Jobs] Prioritization interview (e.g. with card sorting) - screen share
  - Willingness to pay
    - **Never ask "how much would you pay for [X]**
    - find worth of the current problem
      - how much time & money gets spend on the problem / current process
      - Be extra polite
      - example questions
        - > Can I ask what you're currently paying for that [tool] you mentioned?
        - > Can I ask how often you have to do that?
- Debugging interviews
  - no-shows
    - give them 15min, then write a nice email to reschedule
  - interview was shorter than expected
    - summarize, mirror, as digging-deeper questions
    - validate to take fear
  - only get short answers
    - ask if another time would be better
    - should talk to someone else in the organization?
  - Cagey person
    - > What made you interested in talking to me today?
    - > I understand this might be sensitive information. Would it be helpful if I signed an NDA?
  - Only get feature request
    - switch to feature request script

## Part 8 - Analyzing Interviews
- Tools
  - draw a customer journey map (include function, social, emotional and quotes) - p.220
  - pain frequency matrix
    - helps for persona-pain match
    - can be done for general big-picture problems & areas and for each step of a defined process
- Use both tools side-by-side
- Pull from an interview
  - What are they trying to do overall?
  - steps of decision process
  - functional, intellectual social and emotional dimensions that influence the decision-making & satisfaction
  - How strong is the pain? How frequent does the pain occur? What is their willingness to pay?
  - Immediate actions
  - Longer-term thoughts
- Always try to have quotes for your conclusions
