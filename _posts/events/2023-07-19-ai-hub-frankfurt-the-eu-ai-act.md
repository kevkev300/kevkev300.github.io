### Keynote: Overview of the EU AI Act

The keynote presentation focused on the "EU AI Act" and was delivered by Tüv Süd. The talk highlighted the importance of understanding AI risks and pitfalls and how the EU AI Act aims to mitigate them for business success.

#### AI Risks & Pitfalls

The speaker emphasized the various risks associated with AI implementation, including safety, security, legal concerns, performance issues, ethical considerations, and sustainability. It is crucial for businesses to address these risks proactively to ensure the responsible and effective deployment of AI systems.

#### EU AI Act & Standards

The EU AI Act primarily aims to mitigate risks associated with AI implementation. It introduces a penalty of 6% of a company's total worldwide revenue for non-compliance. However, businesses will have a grace period until 2025 if the act is adopted in 2023. Similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU AI Act applies to all companies and does not require adaptation by national governments.

The act classifies the application of AI models based on risk levels, categorizing them as high risk, moderate risk, or minimal/no risk. This risk-based approach allows for targeted regulation and ensures that higher-risk applications receive appropriate scrutiny and oversight.

#### AI Quality and Compliance

To achieve AI quality and compliance, businesses need to adhere to various standards, such as those defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Complying with these standards brings several benefits, including the ability to control and manage risks effectively, build trust with customers, and scale the adoption of AI technologies.

During the keynote, actionable steps were suggested for businesses to take immediately, including investing in AI training, conducting assessments, and seeking advisory services to ensure compliance with standards and regulations.

### Keynote: Impact of the EU AI Act on Transformation

The second keynote presentation delved into the broader impact of the EU AI Act on business transformation. It was emphasized that the act's mandatory requirements apply not only to high-risk AI applications but also to the entire value chain of AI systems.

Furthermore, the keynotes highlighted the close relationship between AI quality and compliance, reinforcing the idea that businesses must prioritize both aspects to ensure successful AI adoption.

To prepare for the implementation of the EU AI Act, the following steps were recommended: conducting assessments and benchmarking, establishing governance and setting directions, and investing in the development of organizational maturity in handling AI technologies.

### Panel Discussion: Digital Ethics & Regulation

The event concluded with a panel discussion focused on digital ethics and regulation. The participants explored various aspects of the EU AI Act and its implications. Some key points discussed were:

- The EU AI Act's management of AI components in software and its impact on EU citizens' fundamental rights.
- The importance of trustworthiness in AI systems and how to determine which AI applications are deemed trustworthy.
- The competitive advantage provided by trust and privacy.
- The importance of auditability and the need for transparency and accountability. E.g.: contracts involving Chinese businesses could have a section guaranteeing that they can be audited.
- The global enforcement of AI standards and the promotion of ethical practices worldwide.
- The recognition that even if a business is regulatory compliant, it may still engage in unethical practices.
- The heterogeneity of privacy regulations within the EU and the need for businesses to take responsibility for their data practices.
- The closing question: Is the EU AI Act perceived as over-regulation or is it seen as a necessary and mandatory step for responsible AI adoption? The discussion emphasized the importance of balancing practicability and feasibility while adapting to evolving AI landscapes.

Overall, the event provided valuable insights into the EU AI Act and its implications for businesses. It underscored the significance of understanding and managing AI risks, complying with relevant standards, and fostering ethical practices to navigate the regulatory landscape successfully.
